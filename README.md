# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction

This project's main goal was to thoroughly assess and choose the best machine learning model for predicting diabetes. This project is significant because it has the potential to improve early intervention and preventive strategies for people who are at risk of acquiring diabetes.

This project aimed to meticulously evaluate and select the most effective machine learning model for predicting diabetes. The process involved a comprehensive analysis of various supervised learning algorithms, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine(SVM), hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The objective was to establish a robust predictive tool capable of identifying individuals at risk of diabetes, thereby enabling timely intervention and preventive measures.
